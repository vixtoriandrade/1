SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
Mock-Up
NOTE
This layout is designed for "desktop", so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the Mock-Up when viewed at a resolution smaller than 768px. In future lessons, you will learn how to make elements "responsive" so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

A webpage titled "Horiseon" features a navigation menu in the header, a hero image, various sections, and more.

Comments are disabled for graded submissions in BootCamp Spot. If you have questions about your feedback, please notify your instructional staff or the Student Success Advisor. If you would like to resubmit your work for an improved grade, you can use the Resubmit Assignment button to upload new links. You may resubmit up to three times for a total of four submissions.

IMPORTANT
No matter how difficult the course becomes, you must always turn in original work. Plagiarism is not tolerated. If your instructional or support staff determine that you have plagiarized work, your Student Success Manager will determine the appropriate course of action based on university policy. Such actions may include, but are not limited to, a documented plagiarism discussion, an incomplete or failing grade assignment, or ineligibility for graduation.

It is your responsibility to include a note in the README section of your repo specifying code source and its location within your repo. This applies if you have worked with a peer on an assignment, used code in which you did not author or create sourced from a forum such as Stack Overflow, or you received code outside curriculum content from support staff such as an Instructor, TA, Tutor, or Learning Assistant. This will provide visibility to grading staff of your circumstance in order to avoid flagging your work as plagiarized.
